All the check boxes at the left column are checked meaning all possibilities. All the check boxes at the right column are unchecked meaning no digit or place is confirmed. You can check menu View -> Autofill Hints to let the computer help you filling some obvious cases.</p></td>

                            <li> Then there is another number which we always know something about: Zero can't be the first digit (forbidden by gamerules). Also add this to the first grid.</li>
                            <li> We have tried the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 but only two of them are in the final number. As we need another two digits and only two are left, we are sure that 0 and 9 are somewhere in the number. Add this to the second grid.</li>
