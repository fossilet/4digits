            <h3><a href="#intro-toc" name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
            <p>4digits is a guess-the-number puzzle game. It's called Bulls and Cows, and in China people simply call it Guess-the-Number. The game's objective is to guess a four-digit number in 8 times using as less time as possible. It is similar to Mastermind, but the four digits are different to each other. 4digits has a graphical user interface version <i>4digits</i> and a textual user interface version <i>4digits-text</i>. This manual demonstrates the GUI version.</p>

            <h3><a href="#install-toc" name="install">Installation</a></h3>
            <p>Before playing 4digits, you need to install python (version 2.7 or below), python-gtk2 and python-glade2 in your computer.</p>
            <h4>Linux</h4>
            <p>Python is usually already installed in your computer if your are a using a modern Linux distribution. You can install python-gtk2 and python-glade2 from the software repository of your distribution.</p>
            <h4>BSD's and Unix's</h4>
            <p>Install python, python-gtk2 and python-glade2 for your system.</p>
            <h4>Windows</h4>
            <p>You need to install <a href='http://python.org/download'>Python</a> and <a href='http://www.pygtk.org/'>PyGTK</a>. Click <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/">here</a> to download the all-in-one PyGTK installer for Windows.</p>
            <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
            <p><a href="http://finkproject.org/">Fink Project</a> has PyGTK and gnome-python2 for Mac OS X. You can try it.</p>

You get one A if its value and position are both correct, and you get one B if only its value is correct. You win the game when you get 4A0B. </p>

                        <p>In Figure 2, you start with 1234. The answer is 5184, which is known somehow. The first guess is 1234, then you get 1A1B. Why? 1A because '4' in 1234 and 5184 has the same value and position, and 1B because '1' in 1234 and 5184 share the same value but different position. If you enter 3456 then, you get 0A2B, because the values of '4' and '5' are right but there positions are not correct.</p>

                        <p>This is an example on how to solve your game with the hint table. The hint table can be toggled from menu <i>View</i> -> <i>Hint Table</i>. All the check boxes of the left column are checked meaning all possibilities, all the check boxes of the right column are unchecked meaning no digit or place is confirmed. That is to say:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Left side:<br />

                            - You uncheck a row if you are sure that this number is not in the answer.</p>
